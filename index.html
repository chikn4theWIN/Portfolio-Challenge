            Hello everyone! My name is Camden Barnard but you can call me Cam!
            I am currently enrolled in the Rice University Software Developer Bootcamp,
            where ive been learning a lot about Software Development. I've recently started creating
            websites that use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hoping to continue my career in technology.
            This would be my first webpage made from scratch! Thank you for your time and interest and take
            a look around at what ive accomplished so far and what I hope to accomplish in the future!
        </p>
